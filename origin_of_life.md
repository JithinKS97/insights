How life originated is a question that has always been continuing to blow my mind.

There are of course more profound questions like, how did the universe itself originate and why is it the way it is with time, space, matter, and forces of nature constituting it?

But let's just accept the fact that the universe exists and is made up of space, matter, and the forces of nature, which are shaping matter to form various structures in it.

Forces of nature cause atoms to form from subatomic particles and atoms join to form molecules through the passage of time.

But from this, how could something as amazing as life originate, and eventually beings like us who are aware of the existence of the universe and ourselves in it that ask deep questions about it?

My goal here is to produce a line of reasoning that could explain the origin of life and eventually more complex lives from very basic assumptions.

One of the inherent properties of our Universe is things that are stable tend to exist more time. For example, if a molecule is formed, and it is stable, it tends to stay for a long time before it is destroyed.

Another observed fact is that atoms can join together to form molecules that have very interesting properties. Some molecules formed are very stable, so they tend to stay longer.

Now assume that a molecule formed that is very stable somehow has obtained the ability to create a copy of itself from the surrounding raw material molecules. We could delve into the complex chemistry of how something like this could happen, but let's not do that and just assume that this happened.

Now what will happen, is more and more copies of this molecule will be created. And since it's stable, it stays for a long period of time, to leave more copies.

There can be multiple variants of this kind of molecule that could create their copies. What would happen is those that who are more stable and have a better ability to create copies would become better and more abundant than others.

The copying mechanism need not be perfect, but there can be small mistakes happening in copying. The mistakes can deter the molecule's survival and copying ability or sometimes even improve the survival and coping ability.

For example, if a molecule somehow through some chemical process develops a protective coating around it, it can have a better chance of survival. Or if a molecule somehow develops the creation of chemicals that destroy other variants, it can better its survival chances by reducing competition.

These molecules by their slow evolution caused the slow development of chemical structures and processes associated with them that enhanced them.

The self-replicating molecule that we have been discussing is the ancestor of genes. Genes have been perfecting their craft of self-replication by forming more and more and more complex structures and functions around them. Eventually, this leads to the formation of cells, where genes sit at the center called the nucleus, surrounded by other structures called organelles that have different functions.

The same slow evolution would have also led to the multiple genes cooperating together leading to the formation of multicellular beings like us.

The process of incremental change in the genes, that produce features and structures that enhance the chances of survival and reproduction, we call natural selection.

All the amazing features of life, intelligence, emotions, and sexual reproduction have been developed through the same process. For example, fear is a feature that enables an organism to escape from danger, which enhances its chances of survival and eventually leaves more copies of itself.

Life can be summarized as stable molecule configurations trying to sustain and spread through space and time.

There is a small catch, the molecules are not perfectly stable, but it is subject to slight variations such that the survival machines built by it successfully survive and reproduce in the environment that they are in!

The range of all the emotions that we experience, the extremes like overwhelming joy and profound sorrow, and all the shades in between, originated from the relentless drive of these simple molecules to survive and reproduce in a hostile and ever-changing environment!
