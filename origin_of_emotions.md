Emotions are an essential part of what makes us human. From the very early days of our lives, to probably the very final day, emotions guide us in how we navigate the world!

Emotions are internal mechanisms evolved to better our chances of survival and reproduction.

Let us think in this way. Suppose we are building a robot whose goal is to not get destroyed and leave maximum copies of itself. What mechanisms would we design such that it does this job in the most efficient way?

We would want it to repeat operations that enhance its survival chances and punish those that reduce it.

We would also want to reward operations that helped it to leave more copies of itself. If we don't do that, since the robot has no incentive for this, it will eventually be faulty and dead (Every machine has a tendency to wear off with the passage of time, and for living things, this happens in the form of death!) leaving behind no copies of itself.

In contrast, if this robot has a high incentive for this, it would eventually leave behind more copies and the copies again leave behind more copies. The reason why the phenomenon of sex occupies such an important bandwidth of our thoughts and actions is because of this. 

Those beings that have high drive and intelligence to be involved in activities that successfully create more copies of themselves will fare better. Their trait will be inherited by their offspring, and this will only improve over time.

I think this is the reason why we love so much gossipping who is mating whom, and there are so much romantic movies, literatures and even porn for that matter because successful reproduction is of utmost importance as far as we are concerned.
