Emotions are an essential part of what makes us human. From the very early days of our lives, to probably the very final day, emotions guide us in how we navigate the world!

Emotions are internal mechanisms evolved to better our chances of survival and reproduction.

Let us think in this way. Suppose we are building a robot whose goal is to not get destroyed and leave maximum copies of itself. What mechanisms would we design such that it does this job in the most efficient way?

We would want it to repeat operations that enhance its survival chances and punish those that reduce it.

## Love and sex
We would also want to reward operations that helped it to leave more copies of itself. If we don't do that, since the robot has no incentive for this, it will eventually be faulty and dead (Every machine has a tendency to wear off with the passage of time, and for living things, this happens in the form of death!) leaving behind no copies of itself.

In contrast, if this robot has a high incentive for this, it would eventually leave behind more copies and the copies again leave behind more copies. The reason why the phenomenon of sex occupies such an important bandwidth of our thoughts and actions is because of this. 

Those beings that have high drive and intelligence to be involved in activities that successfully create more copies of themselves will fare better. Their trait will be inherited by their offspring, and this will only improve over time.

I think this is the reason why we love so much gossiping about who is mating whom, and there are so many romantic movies, literature, and even the high presence of porn on the internet that matter because successful reproduction is of utmost importance as far as we are concerned.

## Fear
It's not difficult to see why the feeling of fear will enhance the chance of survival. It's just a mechanism that would allow the organism to escape from dangers around it which will include dangers from natural phenomena, like fire, height, water, etc. Also, fear of predators and peers who are competing for the same resources. 

Since organisms in each species are fighting for the same resources, food, shelter, and mates. We could imagine competition rising between them and those that are stronger will bully the ones that are not strong.

## Sadness and pain
This is a mechanism that will punish an organism if it does something that would have reduced its chances of survival and reproduction. For example, why do we feel so sad when somebody rejects our romantic advancement or we break up with someone? It induces a high amount of pain in us. This is because that event has reduced reproduction chances. And as we have already seen, reproduction is of utmost importance to us as we are the descendants of ancestorial chain that have successfully reproduced.
