# Origin of Intelligence

We have seen how natural selection could lead to the evolution of features that increase the chances of survival and reproduction of an organism.

We could imagine that if an organism somehow can perceive the surroundings even in a very minimal way, it can significantly improve its chances of survival as this could allow the organism to detect food and enemies more efficiently.

This perception of the environment can increase in complexity so that it becomes closer and closer to reality. The organisms that best perceive the environment will have higher chances of accurately detecting food and enemies.

There are multiple ways to perceive the environment. Light, sound, molecules of gas, etc. are some of them.

Organisms developed the ability of sight, hearing, smell, and touch to detect these external natural phenomena so that they could navigate the environment better for their survival.

Thought ability to perceive the present is advantageous, another advantageous feature to have is to remember situations. This could be the most primitive form of memory.

If the organism could remember strategies that have helped it in the past to get food or escape from enemies, it would have helped the organism.

Now this could evolve to a more sophisticated form.

In the end, the organism could evolve an internal mechanism by which it forms a model of the surroundings.

If within the model, it could simulate strategies it could implement, that also will improve survival chances.

In short thinking and consciousness is an advanced form of this feature where the organism has created a model of the environment that it is in and it is aware of its existence in the model.

Thinking is nothing but simulating various possibilities in which the environment could evolve and choosing the best possibility that enhances it's survival and reproduction chances.
