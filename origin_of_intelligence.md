We have observed how natural selection can result in small genetic variations that gradually lead to the development of traits that improve the survival and reproductive success of organisms.

How could this have led to the formation of intelligence and, eventually, consciousness?

Well, let's think about what it means to be intelligent.

It means an organism has the ability to perceive and think about its environment and take actions that enhance its well-being.

For this, the first ability that is needed is perception of the environment.

In lifeâ€™s simplest stages, the earliest form of this would have been the ability to perceive surroundings and detect food and predators.

To perceive our surroundings, we rely on natural phenomena such as light, sound, and the presence of gas, etc.

These are the means through which we can know what is outside.

The earliest method for achieving this would have been cells that could be sensitive to these natural phenomena.

Even basic mechanisms to detect them would have provided survival benefits, as organisms that possessed them could use them to fare better.

It is possible to imagine that over time these mechanisms would have gradually evolved to become the sense organs that we have today, which help us with our hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch.

These systems are developed to perceive our environment, enabling us to take actions that improve our chances of survival.

The second necessary ability is the capacity to store past experiences. If an organism's response to a particular situation has improved its chances of survival, it can replicate the same strategy the next time it encounters a similar situation.

This would have resulted in the development of primitive forms of memory.

Eventually, this leads to the development of an ability in which the organism can create a model of the world. It can simulate and store various strategies and choose the best one that would result in the greatest benefit.

These developments eventually will lead to a more complex attribute called consciousness. 

A conscious being is capable of creating a model of the world and being aware of its own presence within that model. You and I are so conscious that we are striving to find reasons behind our own existence.

Thinking is the act of simulating how a model, which includes ourselves, will evolve if we choose different courses of action.

After considering various actions and their potential evolution, we select the action that will benefit us the most.

An organism that can do this exceptionally well is considered highly intelligent.

So far we have discussed animals. But there are entire other classes of organisms like plants, fungi etc.

They have different survival challenges as compared to us because of which the mechanisms that were developed in them were different.
