We have seen how natural selection could lead to small variations in the genes which would slowly develop features that enhanced the survival and reproduction chances of organisms.

How could this have led to the formation of intelligence and eventually consciousness?

Well, let's think about what it means to be intelligent and conscious.

It means an organism has the ability to perceive and think about its environment and take actions that would make it better off.

For this, the first ability that is needed is perception of the environment.

When life was very simple, the earliest form of this would have been the ability to perceive surroundings and detect food and predators.

To perceive the surroundings, we need to rely on natural phenomena - light, sound, external substances, etc.

These are the means through which we can know what is it that is outside.

The earliest means for this would have been cells that might be sensitive to these natural phenomena.

Even primitive mechanisms to detect them would have provided survival benefits as the organisms that possessed them could utilize that to survive and reproduce better.

We could imagine that slowly these mechanisms would have evolved to become the sense organs that we have that aid in our hearing, sight, smell, taste, and touch.

These are nothing but systems developed to perceive our environment so that we can take actions that help us survive better.

The second ability that is needed is to store experiences of the past. If a response to some situation has enabled an organism to better its survival chances, it could copy the same strategy next time when it is in the same environment.

This would have led to the formation of primitive forms of memory. 

Eventually, this leads to the formation of an ability in which the organism could form a model of the world and it could simulate and store different strategies and opt for the best strategy that would make it better off. 

I think this is how consciousness develops. 

A conscious being is able to create a model of the world and it is aware of its own presence in the model.

Thinking is nothing but simulating how the model with ourselves present in it will evolve if we take different courses of action.

After taking into consideration many actions and many ways in which it will evolve, we choose the action that will favor us in the best way.

An organism that has the ability to do this in the best way is said to be very intelligent and conscious.

So you are said to be conscious because you are aware of the existence of the world and yourself in it.

So far we have discussed animals. But there are plants also. Plants have different survival challenges as compared to us because of which the mechanisms that were developed in them were different.
